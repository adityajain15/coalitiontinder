With 80 seats, UP is likely to have a significant impact on the upcoming 2019 General Elections.</section><section class=mv5>The researchers pursue two methods of assessing the impact of the grand coalition. In the first method, they aggregate results from assembly constituencies (each of which belongs to a particular parliamentary constituency) to create a faux General Election result. The highest vote getter, coalitions also considered, in such a faux Parliamentary constituency is declared to be a winner. In the second method, results from the 2014 general election are recalculated such that the vote shares of all parties in the grand coalition are added together in order to determine a winner. Both methods assume a vote transfer of 100% and no swing against (or for) the BJP.</section><section class=mv5>Their analysis indicates that even without a negative swing the BJP faces an uphill battle in its quest to repeat its landslide 2014 victory in UP, where the party won 71 out of 80 seats (excluding 2 seats that were won by its ally, Apna Dal).</section><section class=mv5>In order to let readers see how coalitions can change electoral outcomes, The Wire has developed an interactive tool with a number of options. The tool below allows you to make your own coalitions and assess the impacts of such would-be coalitions. In addition, it also lets you specify vote swings – that are likely to be a big factor in this election considering the anti-incumbency factor against the BJP/NDA.</section><section class="w-90 center mv3 bg-white pa2"><span class="rajdhani bold underline tc db">The Rules of the Game</span><ol class="center f4"><li class=mv3>Parties belonging to the same coalition have their 2014 General Election votes consolidated under the banner of their respective coalitions</li><li class=mv3>Parties that don’t belong to a coalition compete independently and are known as ‘Non-Aligned Parties’</li><li class=mv3>All votes are adjusted according to the current national/statewide percentage vote swings before declaring a winner</li><li class=mv3>Consistent with first-past-the-post voting, the coalition or independent party with the highest number of votes in each constituency is declared to be the winner for that constituency</li><li class=mv3>Seat gains are visually represented by crosshatched hexagons that are color coded according to their coalitions (see legend below)</li></ol></section></article><div id=app></div><article class="w-100 measure-ns center f3 mt6" style="font-family: Georgia;"><section class=mv5>The interactive facilitates the visual representation of many overarching themes in modern Indian politics the starkest of which is the ascendancy of regional parties and the simultaneous decline of the Indian National Congress. For such regional parties, however, a bigger vote share hasn’t necessarily translated into electoral victories but it does mean that we have witnessed a fragmentation of the electorate, in states such as Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Delhi among many others, that chiefly benefits national parties like the BJP as it did in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.</section><h3 class="rajdhani bold lh-subtitle f2 tc">Caveats</h3><section class=mt5>The discerning reader will surely notice the reductive nature of the methodology here. As the authors of the article on Uttar Pradesh acknowledge, a chief cause of concern amongst the leaders of the <i class=i>Mahagathbandan</i> today is whether they will leak any of their combined vote shares to the BJP. Our model assumes that all votes will transfer 100% when a party joins a coalition, which is surely over-optimistic.</section></article></main><footer class="black f4"><div class="mw9 center w-75 pv4" style="color: white;"><span class="db pv3">Pranjali Kureel contributed towards the making of this piece</span> <span class="db pv3">Edited by Siddharth Varadarajan and Raghu Karnad</span><h3 class="pt3 underline">Data</h3><span class="db pb3">From the Election Commission of India (<a href=https://eci.gov.in/files/file/2785-constituency-wise-detailed-result/ style="color:white !important;">Link</a>)</span><h3 class="pt3 underline">Methodology for Vote Swings</h3><span class=lh-copy>A vote swing can be applied to a party nation-wide or within specific states.</span><ol class="pb3 lh-copy"><li>The total number of votes to be increased/decreased is calculated as a percentage of the total votes polled nationally (or in a collection of states in a statewide swing)</li><li>The number of votes to be increased in a particular constituency is proportional to the coalition/party's past performance in that constituency (Number of votes for the coalition/party in that constituency divided by the nationwide or statewide votes for the coalition/party)</li><li>In the event of a vote decrease for a coalition/party in a particular constituency, the votes for all other coalitions/parties are increased proportional to their voteshares (Number of votes for the other coalition/party divided by the total votes for all other coalitions/parties in that constituency excluding the swing coalition/party)</li><li>In the event of a vote increase for a coalition/party in a particular constituency, the votes for all other coalitions/parties are decreased proportional to their voteshares (Number of votes for the other coalition/party divided by the total votes for all other coalitions/parties in that constituency excluding the swing coalition/party)</li></ol></div></footer><script src=/the-election-game/js/chunk-vendors.96b4443b.js></script><script src=/the-election-game/js/app.21ff2337.js></script></body></html>
