The article, written by two researchers at IIT Guwahati and UMass Amherst, uses data from past elections conducted in the Uttar Pradesh, a state that carries the highest number of seats in India’s electoral system and the results of which are likely to have a significant impact on the upcoming 2019 General Elections.</section><section class=mv5>The researchers propose two methods of assessing the impact of three strong regional parties joining hands to form the Grand Coalition, also known as the Mahagathbandan. In the first method, they propose a model that aggregates results from Assembly constituencies (each of which belongs to a particular parliamentary constituency) to create a faux General Election result. The highest vote getter, coalitions also considered, in such a faux Parliamentary constituency is declared to be a winner. In a second method, results from the 2014 general election are recalculated such that all parties in the grand coalition are treated as a single entity in order to determine a winner. Both models assume a vote transfer of 100%</section><section class=mv5>Both models indicate that the BJP faces an uphill battle in its quest to repeat its landslide 2014 victory in Uttar Pradesh where they secured 71 out of 80 seats (excluding 2 seats that were won by its ally Apna Dal). The researchers point out that the BJP has been able to gain electoral victories primarily because of triangular or quadrilateral contests and state that these gains would be overshadowed by a coalition of these parties that have been historical rivals — a conjecture that is validated to some degree by the fact that the BSP and SP have consistently maintained a vote share that is close to or larger than what the BJP managed to get in 2014.</section><section class=mv5>To take this idea to the next level, we implemented the researcher’s latter method on a national scale using a visual interactive. The interactive below allows you to make your own coalitions and assess the impacts of such a would-be coalitions. In addition, it also lets you specify vote swings that are likely to be a big factor in this election considering the anti-incumbency factor against the BJP/NDA.</section><section class="w-90 center mv3 bg-white pa2"><span class="rajdhani bold underline tc db">The Rules of the Game</span><ol class="center f4"><li class=mv3>Parties belonging to the same coalition have their 2014 General Election votes consolidated under the banner of their respective coalitions</li><li class=mv3>Parties that don’t belong to a coalition compete independently and are known as ‘Non-Aligned Parties’</li><li class=mv3>All votes are adjusted according to the current national/statewide percentage vote swings before declaring a winner</li><li class=mv3>Consistent with first-past-the-post voting, the coalition or independent party with the highest number of votes in each constituency is declared to be the winner for that constituency</li><li class=mv3>Seat gains are visually represented by crosshatched hexagons that are color coded according to their coalitions (see legend below)</li></ol></section></article><div id=app></div><article class="w-100 measure-ns center f3 mt6" style="font-family: Georgia;"><section class=mv5>The interactive facilitates the visual representation of many overarching themes in modern Indian politics the starkest of which is the ascendancy of regional parties and the simultaneous decline of the Indian National Congress. For such regional parties, however, a bigger vote share hasn’t necessarily translated into electoral victories but it does mean that we have witnessed a fragmentation of the electorate, in states such as Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Delhi among many others, that chiefly benefits national parties like the BJP as it did in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.</section><h3 class="rajdhani bold lh-subtitle f2 tc">Caveats</h3><section class=mt5>The discerning reader will surely notice the reductive nature of the methodology employed by the authors of the published article, however, this is something that the authors themselves acknowledge. A chief cause of concern amongst the leaders of the Mahagathbandan today is whether they will leak any of their combined voteshares to the BJP. Our model assumes that all votes will transfer 100% which is surely over-optimistic, however as the authors point out “(BSP, SP, RLD) voters rely on caste loyalties, which are not readily mutable” and there is evidence in the Mahagathbandan’s victories in the recent Uttar Pradesh bye-elections that this model is worth taking seriously if not literally</section></article></main><footer class="black f4"><div class="mw9 center w-75 pv4" style="color: white;"><span class="db pv3">Pranjali Kureel contributed towards the making of this piece</span> <span class="db pv3">Edited by Siddharth Varadarajan and Raghu Karnad</span><h3 class="pt3 underline">Data</h3><span class="db pb3">From the Election Commission of India (<a href=https://eci.gov.in/files/file/2785-constituency-wise-detailed-result/ style="color:white !important;">Link</a>)</span><h3 class="pt3 underline">Methodology for Vote Swings</h3><span class=lh-copy>A vote swing can be applied to a party nation-wide or within specific states.</span><ol class="pb3 lh-copy"><li>The total number of votes to be increased/decreased is calculated as a percentage of the total votes polled nationally (or in a collection of states in a statewide swing)</li><li>The number of votes to be increased in a particular constituency is proportional to the coalition/party's past performance in that constituency (Number of votes for the coalition/party in that constituency divided by the nationwide or statewide votes for the coalition/party)</li><li>In the event of a vote decrease for a coalition/party in a particular constituency, the votes for all other coalitions/parties are increased proportional to their voteshares (Number of votes for the other coalition/party divided by the total votes for all other coalitions/parties in that constituency excluding the swing coalition/party)</li><li>In the event of a vote increase for a coalition/party in a particular constituency, the votes for all other coalitions/parties are decreased proportional to their voteshares (Number of votes for the other coalition/party divided by the total votes for all other coalitions/parties in that constituency excluding the swing coalition/party)</li></ol></div></footer><script src=/coalitiontinder/js/chunk-vendors.96b4443b.js></script><script src=/coalitiontinder/js/app.f31fab24.js></script></body></html>
